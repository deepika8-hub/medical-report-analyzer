# Clinical Intelligence Engine
AI-powered medical report analyzer using OCR, rule-based NLP, and clinical risk scoring.

---

## Overview

Clinical Intelligence Engine is a prototype system that processes medical reports in PDF format, extracts clinical parameters, identifies abnormal values, assigns patient risk level, and generates structured medical insights.

The system demonstrates how AI can assist healthcare professionals by quickly interpreting laboratory reports and highlighting potential health risks.

This prototype uses a multi-stage pipeline including OCR text extraction, medical value parsing, abnormality detection, risk classification, explanation generation, and ICD/CPT medical coding support.

## Features

### Medical Report Processing
- Upload PDF medical reports
- OCR fallback for scanned documents
- Extract structured clinical values from text

### Clinical Analysis
- Detect abnormal laboratory values
- Assign risk category (Low / Medium / High)
- Generate an explanation of abnormal findings

### Supported Medical Indicators
- Complete Blood Count (CBC)
- Glucose
- Creatinine
- Bilirubin
- AST / ALT / ALP
- Oncology keywords (biopsy text detection)

### Medical Coding
- ICD-10 diagnostic codes (limited coverage)
- CPT test procedure codes

### Multi-agent pipeline
1. Extraction Agent
2. Validation Agent
3. Clinical Analysis Agent
4. Decision Agent
5. Explanation Agent
6. Coding Agent

### Dashboard Interface
- Upload report
- View patient summary
- View key insights
- Clinical explanation
- Trends visualization
- Extracted values
- Medical coding view
- Technical JSON output

## API Endpoint

### Process medical report

POST /process

Input:
- PDF file

Output:
- risk level
- explanation
- extracted values
- ICD codes
- CPT codes
- workflow trace

## Example Output

```

{
"risk": "High",
"insights": [
"hemoglobin: Low",
"white blood cells: High."
],
"explanation": [
"Hemoglobin is lower than the normal range."
]
}

```

## Current Limitations

- limited disease coverage
- Rule-based extraction may miss uncommon report formats
- ICD coding coverage is partial
- Clinical interpretation is simplified for prototype demonstration

---

## Future Improvements

- expand disease coverage
- improve NLP understanding of clinical text
- support additional lab tests
- improve coding coverage
- integrate medical knowledge graph
- improve OCR accuracy for complex layouts

---

## Use Case

This system can assist in:

- rapid triage of patient reports
- highlighting abnormal clinical values
- generating structured summaries
- supporting clinical decision workflows
